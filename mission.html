            <h3>We're leading a movement to
                reimagine fast food for a new era.</h3>
            <p>Our core values guide our actions and
                we aim to empower our customers, team
                members and partners to be a positive
                force on the food system. That's why
                we're building a transparent supply
                network, why we cook from scratch, and
                why we're building a community of
                people who believe in the power of real
                food.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Were in the
                business of
                feeding people,
                and we're out to

            <h3>We started sweetgreen as three
                college students who were simply
                looking for a healthier way to eat.</h3>
            <p>
                When we were in school, there were two
                choices: food that was slow, expensive,
                and fresh- or fast, cheap, and unhealthy
                We saw an opportunity to create a
                business where quality was never
                sacrificed for convenience. On August
                1st 2007, two months after graduating,
                we opened sweetgreen in Washington
                DC, and served our first customers with
                a vision to reimagine fast food.

            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>We believe that
                climate change
                is the defining
                challenge of our
                generation</p>

            <h2>We're committed to becoming
                carbon neutral by the end of 2027.</h2>
            <p>In a world where the long- and short-
                term effects of climate change pose
                major challenges for farmers, the need
                for regenerative food systems has never
                been more important. That's why we've
                made a promise to do more for the
                planet, by taking less. Our plant-forward
                menu means that we're already on
                average 30% less carbon intensive than
                the average American meal.</p>
